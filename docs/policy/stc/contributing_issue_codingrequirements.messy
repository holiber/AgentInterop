title: Coding Issue Requirements
description: Defines the required structure and decision rules for issues that involve code changes.
---

Purpose

This policy defines how to create a task (issue) that requires code changes.

Its goal is to ensure that coding issues are:
	•	Short but clear
	•	Understandable by humans and AI agents
	•	Safe to execute
	•	Properly scoped

⸻

Scope

This policy applies to any issue that requires writing, modifying, or deleting code.

⸻

Issue Text Requirements
	•	The issue description must be concise
	•	The intent and motivation must be explicit
	•	Avoid long narratives and implicit assumptions

⸻

Required Section: Intent

Any issue that requires code changes must contain the following section.

## Intent

### What we are doing
(Describe the concrete changes to be made)

### Why we are doing this
(Explain the problem, value, or motivation)

Rules:
	•	Both subsections are required
	•	“Why” must not restate “What”
	•	The text must be understandable without external context

⸻

Issue Scoping & Labeling

When creating a coding issue, think explicitly about scope.

Label Check
	•	Verify whether additional labels are required:
	•	bug
	•	refactor
	•	proposal
	•	epic
	•	autocode (human-applied only)
	•	Labels signal intent and permissions, not just categorization

Split vs Single Issue
	•	Do not split an issue into multiple ones if:
	•	The total expected code change is small or moderate
(≈ < 600 lines of code)
	•	The work is logically cohesive
	•	In such cases, prefer:
	•	A single issue
	•	A TODO checklist inside the issue
	•	Incremental pushes
	•	Checking completed TODO items ✅

When to Split or Create an Epic

Consider splitting the work or creating an Epic if:
	•	The issue spans multiple independent concerns
	•	The work naturally forms stages or tiers
	•	The scope is unclear or exploratory
	•	The expected implementation is large or risky

⸻

Relationship to Coding Workflow Policy

All coding issues must follow:

contributing_issue_codingworkflow

This policy defines the full lifecycle:
	•	Starting work
	•	Implementing changes
	•	Validation and review

⸻

AI Agent Rules (IMPORTANT)

Additional constraints apply when an issue is executed by an AI agent:
	•	AI agents must follow:
	•	contributing_issue_codingworkflow
	•	AI agents must not infer missing intent
	•	If the Intent section is missing or unclear:
	•	The AI agent must stop
	•	A clarification or proposal issue must be created

⸻

Recommendations (Explicitly Optional)

The following sections are recommended, not required:
	•	Acceptance criteria
	•	Known risks or edge cases
	•	Non-goals
	•	Related issues or epics

Optional sections must be clearly marked as such.

⸻

General Principles
	•	Short and clear beats detailed and vague
	•	One well-scoped issue is better than many tiny ones
	•	Use epics for coordination, not bureaucracy
	•	If an AI agent cannot confidently execute the issue, the issue is invalid
