# Policy create/change
Purpose

This policy defines how new policies are introduced and how existing policies are modified.

Its goal is to keep project governance:
	•	Clear
	•	Minimal
	•	Consistent
	•	Understandable by humans and AI agents

⸻

When a Policy Change Is Needed

A policy change is required when:
	•	A new rule or constraint is introduced
	•	Existing behavior needs clarification
	•	AI or human actions require stricter or safer boundaries
	•	Repeated ambiguity or mistakes are observed

⸻

Proposal Requirement

Any creation or modification of a policy must start with a proposal.

Rules
	•	The proposal must use the proposal label
	•	The proposal may be created by humans or AI agents
	•	AI agents must follow contributing_ai_proposal

⸻

Policy Text Requirements

Every policy document must follow these rules:

1. Be Minimal and Explicit
	•	Explain the policy in the shortest form possible
	•	Avoid unnecessary wording
	•	Prefer rules over descriptions

2. Be Human- and AI-Readable
	•	Use simple, direct language
	•	Avoid implicit assumptions
	•	Avoid metaphors or vague terms

3. Describe the Goal

Each policy must clearly state its goal, explaining:
	•	What problem it solves
	•	Why it exists

4. Define Enforced Rules
	•	Use clear “must / must not / should” language
	•	Rules must be deterministic and testable

5. Allow Examples When Helpful
	•	Code examples are allowed if they improve understanding
	•	Examples must be correct and minimal
	•	Examples are optional, not required

Structure of a Policy Document

Recommended structure:

# Policy Name

## Purpose
(Why this policy exists)

## Rules
(Explicit, enforceable rules)

## Examples (Optional)
(Minimal examples if needed)


⸻

Approval & Modification Rules
	•	Policy changes must be reviewed before adoption
	•	Policies should not contradict existing policies
	•	If a conflict is discovered:
	•	A proposal to resolve the conflict must be created

⸻

AI Agent Constraints
	•	AI agents must not modify policies directly
	•	AI agents may:
	•	Propose policy changes
	•	Suggest clarifications
	•	Applying a policy change requires human approval

⸻

General Principles
	•	Policies are contracts, not suggestions
	•	Fewer policies are better than many unclear ones
	•	Clarity is more important than completeness
	•	If a policy cannot be clearly followed by an AI agent, it must be revised

⸻

If you want next, I can:
	•	Generate a policy proposal template
	•	Create a policy linter checklist
	•	Align this with your other contributing_* documents_policy_change.md
